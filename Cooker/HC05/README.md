# HC05

This module is one of the more obvious choices for bluetooth communications. Thanks to its popularity on forums and projects alike, it is very hard to encounter an unsolvable problem with this module.
HC05 connects to the microcontroller via UART communication. In order to establish data transfer with a microcontroller, it first needs to be set up using the UART protocol. To simplify the process, HC05 is outfitted with 6 pins: STATE, RX, TX, GND, VCC and ENABLE.
There are also other pins which need to be soldered to the signal source but these are not crucial for standard use cases.

Setting of parameters can be visualized using any program dedicated to serial communication, but instead of installing another program I decided to use a spare Arduino board and IDE.
The configuration is done as follows:

* connect the GND, VCC and ENABLE pins of HC05 to GND, 5V and 3.3V pins of Arduino respectively
* upload an empty sketch to the Arduino board
* connect the RX and TX pins of HC05 and Arduino board
* open the Serial Monitor and select the "Both NL and CR" and "38400 Baud" options

The datasheet of HC05 lists all of the recognized commands as well as expected responses, but only few of them are essential to set up the module. Below is a list of those commands and expected responses:

* AT ->  OK
* AT+UART? -> 38400,0,0
* AT+ROLE? -> *role of the module, 0 for slave, 1 for master*
* AT+ADDR? -> *address of the module*

Note that the response for UART command is somewhat misleading: 38400 is the baud rate (data transfer speed) in bits per second, the first 0 indicates ONE stop bit, and the second 0 signifies NO parity bit. 
In my case the baud rate only applies to the configuration mode, while in the standard mode it defaults to 9600 baud rate and cannot be changed. This might depend on the firmware of the module.

To enable communication between two HC05 modules, one must be set up as a master, and one as a slave. This is done by sending the command "AT+ROLE=x", where x is 1 for the master, and 0 for slave.

## Testing
The easiest way to check if everything works as intended is to connect to the module via Bluetooth app on a cell phone and see how Black Pill reacts to different data. I used +ime appa+, tweaked the settings to show and send HEX data to send 1 byte at a time.
On the programming side of things, I came up with a simple code so that the blue LED on the board switches on or off depending on the input. Before uploading the code to the board, it is neccessary to adjust a few settings in STM32 Cube MX:
* System Core -> SYS -> Debug: Serial Wire
* Connectivity -> USART1 -> Asynchronous -> Parameter settings -> Baud rate: 9600, Size: 8 bits (including parity), Parity bit: none
						 				 -> NVIC Settings -> Enable USART interrupt
* On Pinout View, select PC13 as GPIO_Output
