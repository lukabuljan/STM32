# DS18B20

This sensor stands out from other sensors and modules with absence of conventional communication protocols such as UART or I2C. Instead, it uses a uniquely designed, one-wire, half-duplex communication to send and receive data.
The sensor is outfitted with three wires: red for VCC, black for GND and yellow which serves to send/receive data. It reliably detects temperatures up to 125 degrees Celsius and stores temp. data in a 16 bit sign-extended two's complement register.
